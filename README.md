# ColorChooser.java

This is a simple ColorChooser that I built in Java while following along to a YouTube video. 

What it does?
It is able to change the color of the font by clicking the button, which will show a dialog box to select from
a variety of colors. 

What I learn to do in this project?
By creating an ActionListener, it is able to perform the change of color in the ActionPerformed.
In the constructor: I made a simple button and can edit the font of my choosing.
In the ActionPerformed: the JColorChooser can select a color and display a dialog box in the showDialog when clicking on the button.
To implement the changes, I was to change the color by setForeground on the label.
